I am a university student developer who likes physics and math. As a person who likes to understand basic principles when exploring something, i enjoys thinking about writing clean code that works with systematic data structures and optimized algorithms. If I have a goal or a problem I want to solve, I dig deep and try to implement and solve it somehow, and if I have enough time, I have re-coded the code for a better structure several times. Based on this experience, I am currently designing data and communication structures and algorithms several times before implementing them. According to this character, I am mainly responsible for backend or server development when developing web and app.
